# LeetCode Solutions in Python

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! Here, you will find Python solutions to various LeetCode problems, organized by problem name. Each folder corresponds to a specific problem on LeetCode and contains a README file with the problem statement and a Python script file with my solution.

## Structure

The repository is organized in the following structure:

- **Problem Name 1**
  - `README.md`: Contains the problem statement.
  - `solution.py`: Python script with my solution.

- **Problem Name 2**
  - `README.md`: Contains the problem statement.
  - `solution.py`: Python script with my solution.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are provided for learning and reference purposes. While I strive to ensure the correctness and efficiency of the solutions, they may not be the only or optimal solutions. It's essential to understand that there can be multiple ways to approach and solve a problem. Additionally, LeetCode problems are frequently updated, and new ones are added, so the solutions here may not always reflect the latest changes on the platform.

Feel free to explore, learn, and adapt the solutions to enhance your problem-solving skills. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or alternative solutions, I encourage you to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy coding!
